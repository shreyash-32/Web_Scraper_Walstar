##  Notes  
- Google Maps data comes from **SerpApi** (free tier has 100 searches/month).  
- If no emails are found, the business is skipped.  
- Some sites may hide emails in images, PDFs, or JS, which arenâ€™t captured yet.

##  Challenges Faced 
  There were multiple challenges in this project like:-

- Getting E-mails of the companies as they are not listed openly on any public platform so I had to scrape email from the companies   
  website
- The same challenge was with phone number
- I used google maps to scrape data which needed to get its API key ,I faced problems in getting it from Google cloud so I used SerpApi      
  for the key
